# Force

Rust CLI for managing parallel AI development environments.

## Overview

Force is a "force multiplier" for AI-assisted development. It enables running multiple AI agents in parallel, each working on separate features in isolated environments. Force handles the coordination challenges—git worktrees, port allocation, database names, environment configuration—so agents don't step on each other's toes. The goal is to let developers scale their AI assistance horizontally without conflicts.

## Development

- Answer Rust questions when asked
- Write idiomatic, simple Rust
- `cargo build` / `cargo run -- up my-feature` / `cargo test`
- Use single-line commit messages
